# Athletics_Fantasy_Team
R Personal Project 

## Project Description
As a scout for an athletics team, I would need to know more than just far an athlete has jumped or thrown once. I need to know who is the most consistent, who fouls the least and who comes through in the clutch, and I need to decide which apsects are most important to the team so I can find the right balance. In my R personal project, I use the *dplyr* package to find out who should be on the team. 

## Project Tasks
1) Athletics needs a new breed of scouts and managers
2) Managers love tidy data
3) Every throw matter
4) Find the clutch performers
5) Pull the pieces together for a new look at the athletes
6) Normalize the data to compare across stats
7) What matters most when building a team?
8) Get to know the players
9) Make the case to the front office and management
10) Time to throw down
